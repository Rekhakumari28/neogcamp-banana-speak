            Convert from English to Pig Latin. Pig Latin is a constructed language game in which words in English are
            altered according to a simple set of rules. Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an
            English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an ay. For example, pig yields igpay, banana
            yields ananabay, and trash yields ashtray or rashtay (dependent on location/preferences). The objective is
            to conceal the meaning of the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a
            deliberate misnomer, as it is simply a form of jargon, used only for its English connotations as a strange
            and foreign-sounding language.
